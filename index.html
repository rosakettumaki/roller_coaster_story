            Picture a perfect summer day at a local carnival. You’ve had your cotton candy, enjoyed a spin on the carousel, and now it’s time for the main event - the roller coaster. A typical family coaster might give you a tickle in your stomach, but its speed remains fairly modest, usually between 25–37 mph. Venture beyond small-town amusement parks, and you’ll find something more intense, like the legendary Coney Island Cyclone in New York City. This wooden icon, standing 85 feet tall, reaches a thrilling 60 mph.

            But then, there are the monsters of the coaster world. The ones that climb as high as skyscrapers and race at speeds of the Formula 1 cars. These engineering marvels fall into three elite categories: Hyper, Giga, and Strata Coasters, classified by their towering heights. To earn the prestigious Strata Coaster status, a ride must exceed 400 feet—a category so extreme that, until now, only one coaster held the title: Superman: Escape from Krypton at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California.

            That’s about to change. In 2025, Saudi Arabia will break every record in the book with Falcon’s Flight, set to open in Six Flags Qiddiya. This coaster won’t just claim the title of the tallest in the world—it will shatter the speed record, leaving even the fastest coasters in its dust.

        <p>Roller coasters date back to the 17th century, but the modern versions we know today emerged in the 1800s in the United States, primarily constructed from wood. Over time, materials evolved, but all coasters still fall into three main categories: wooden, steel, or hybrid.

            Take the Coney Island Cyclone, for example. This wooden legend has been thrilling riders since 1927—nearly a century of heart-pounding excitement. And with a speed of 60 mph, it’s still no joke.

            While the U.S. played a major role in the evolution of roller coasters, the Middle East has dominated record-breaking designs in the 21st century. In 2010, the United Arab Emirates unveiled Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi. With a jaw-dropping top speed of 149 mph, this steel beast wasn’t just a roller coaster—it was an F1 car on tracks, nearly matching an F1 race’s average lap speed.

            But now, Saudi Arabia is taking things even further. Falcon’s Flight is set to **crush the speed record, hitting an unprecedented 155 mph—**a full 6 mph faster than Formula Rossa.
</p>

        <p>While the U.S. and UAE have dominated the records for height and speed, Japan holds the crown for the world’s longest roller coaster.
            Since 2000, Steel Dragon 2000 at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan has remained unmatched in length. But the new Falcon’s Flight won’t just be faster and taller—it will be even longer. While exact numbers are still being finalized, early reports suggest that it will exceed Steel Dragon 2000’s length and be more than twice as long as Formula Rossa.

            (Exact lengths converted to miles to be updated.)

            This means Falcon’s Flight will break records in every category—height, speed, and length—becoming the most extreme roller coaster on Earth.
