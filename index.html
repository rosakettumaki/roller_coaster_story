        <p>Picture a perfect summer day at a local carnival.</p>

        <p>You’ve had cotton candy, taken a spin on the carousel, and now it’s time for the main event—the roller coaster.</p>

        <p>A typical family coaster might give you a little stomach flutter, but it keeps things pretty tame, usually cruising between 25–37 mph. Step outside small-town amusement parks, and you’ll find something with a bit more. Like the legendary Coney Island Cyclone in New York City. This wooden icon, standing 85 feet tall, hits a thrilling 60 mph.</p>

        <p>But then, there are the true giants of the coaster world. The ones that soar as high as skyscrapers and race at speeds rivaling Formula 1 cars. These engineering marvels fall into three elite categories: Hyper, Giga, and Strata Coasters, classified by their towering heights. To earn Strata Coaster status, a ride must exceed 400 feet—a category so extreme that, until now, only one coaster held the title: Superman: Escape from Krypton at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California.</p>

        <p>That’s about to change. In 2025, Saudi Arabia is set to rewrite the record books with Falcon’s Flight, opening at Six Flags Qiddiya in Riyadh.</p>

        <p>Roller coasters trace their roots back to the 17th century, but the modern versions we know today began taking shape in the 1800s in the United States, where they were primarily built from wood. Over time, materials evolved, yet all coasters still fall into two main categories: wooden or steel.Take the Coney Island Cyclone, for example. This wooden legend has been thrilling riders since 1927. Imagine the top speed of 60 mph, at the opening day almost hudred years ago! .</p>

        <p>While the U.S. played a major role in the early evolution of roller coasters, the Middle East has taken the lead in record-breaking designs in the 21st century. In 2010, the United Arab Emirates unveiled Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi. With a jaw-dropping top speed of 149 mph, this steel beast wasn’t just a roller coaster—it was an F1 car on tracks, nearly matching the average lap speed of a Formula 1 race.</p>

        <p>But now, Saudi Arabia is pushing the limits even further. Falcon’s Flight is set to obliterate the speed record, reaching an unprecedented 155 mph—a full 6 mph faster than Formula Rossa.</p>

        <p>While the U.S. and UAE have dominated the records for height and speed, Japan holds the crown for the world’s longest roller coaster.
            Since 2000, Steel Dragon 2000 at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan has remained unmatched in length. But the new Falcon’s Flight won’t just be faster and taller—it will be even longer. While exact numbers are still being finalized, early reports suggest that it will exceed Steel Dragon 2000’s length and be more than twice as long as Formula Rossa.

            (Exact lengths converted to miles to be updated.)

            This means Falcon’s Flight will break records in every category—height, speed, and length—becoming the most extreme roller coaster on Earth.
