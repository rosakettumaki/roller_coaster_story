***ROLLER COASTER STORY***

***Goal***

Build an article about the new roller coaster that is set to surpass all others in the world in the three main categories: speed, length, and height.

This story was created as a coursework project at Columbia Journalism School, with the primary focus on the workflow—how to develop a data-driven idea, find and clean the data, visualize it, and build a webpage within a limited timeframe.

***Tech stack used:***
HTML / CSS
Excel
DataWrapper

***Process summary***

1. Getting the data
The first step was finding the right data. It turned out that ChatGPT could easily convert screenshots from the Roller Coaster Database into CSV files, eliminating the need for scraping. Once I had the CSV files, I cleaned the data to fit my needs.

2. Visualizing the data
I used Datawrapper to create the charts.

I experimented with different approaches but ultimately decided that simplicity is best. I used classic bar charts for all three visualizations, giving the article a clean and consistent look.

3. Building the webpage
I started by mixing two different templates, found a great photo on www.pexels.com, and finally embedded my Datawrapper charts into the page.

***What did I learn? How could this be improved?***

This is just the beginning of my journey as a data journalist, and this project was an incredibly valuable learning experience. I didn’t face any major issues, but there were plenty of small, frustrating challenges, especially with styling and setting up a properly functioning GitHub repository.

With more time, I’d like to create more innovative charts and possibly include additional information about the manufacturers and costs of these roller coasters.

On a more technical level, with some adjustments to the framing of the text, an auto-updating scraper could be developed to pull real-time data from the Roller Coaster Database.
